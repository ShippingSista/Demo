I am lookiog for one that is better suited to work from home and allows me the opportunity to work on a project basis.  I enjoyed the work that I have done in the past with database maintenance and I wish to continue that with the ability to interprete that data for various orgainizations to help them develop a better action plan to retain customers.  Customer churn and product/service development are interesting to me and I would like to further my skills utilizing the new age of Data Science methodologies._ "
